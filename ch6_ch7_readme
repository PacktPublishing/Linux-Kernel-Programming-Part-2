*UPDATE*
With the 2nd Edition of the 'Linux Kernel Programming' book being released (Feb
2024), the following locations have updated code:

Chapter 12, Kernel Synchronization - Part 1 :
 https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Linux-Kernel-Programming_2E/tree/main/ch12

Chapter 13, Kernel Synchronization - Part 2
 https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Linux-Kernel-Programming_2E/tree/main/ch13 

(Of course, the LKP 2E book's Ch 11 and Ch 12 should be read to make the most of these.)
